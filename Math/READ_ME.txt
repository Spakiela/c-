Okay, I need to think this one through. What is multiplication?

If I want to multiply 3 x 4, what does that mean?

Well, assume we have a variable (lets call it 'i'), and i= 3. To i, we want to increment
it i-times, n < 4, times. 

I got the multiplication method to work. I think I would like to be able to use our
add() method in it though, but I have no idea how I might do that. I think that might
cut down on the number of variables that I need to use in this one program. It proabably 
would make the code make more sense, while also making it more obscure.
